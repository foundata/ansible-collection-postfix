# Default variables and values for this role.
#
# These variables are designed to be easily overridden (as they have a low
# precedence) and typically allow users to customize the role's behavior.
# Each variable should have a clear comment above it, describing its purpose
# and how it fits into the role's functionality.

---

# Determines whether the managed resources should be `present` or `absent`.
#
# `present` ensures that required components, such as software packages, are
# installed and configured.
#
# `absent` reverts changes as much as possible, such as removing packages,
# deleting created users, stopping services, restoring modified settings, …
#
# - Type: str
# - Required: No
# - Default: present
# - Choices: present, absent
run_postfix_state: "present"

# If set to `true`, all managed packages will be upgraded during each Ansible
# run (e.g., when the package provider detects a newer version than the
# currently installed one).
#
# - Type: bool
# - Required: No
# - Default: false
run_postfix_autoupgrade: false

# Defines the status of the service(s). Possible values:
#
# - `enabled`: Service is running and will start automatically at boot.
# - `disabled`: Service is stopped and will not start automatically at boot.
# - `running``: Service is running but will not start automatically at boot.
#   This can be used to start a service on the first Ansible run without
#   enabling it for boot.
# - `unmanaged`: Service will not start at boot, and Ansible will not manage its
#   running state. This is primarily useful when services are monitored and
#   managed by systems other than Ansible.
#
# The singular form ("service") is used for simplicity. However, the defined
# status applies to all services if multiple are being managed by this role.
#
# - Type: str
# - Required: No

# - Choices: enabled, disabled, running, unmanaged
run_postfix_service_state: "enabled"

# Additional configuration for Postfix daemon (additional config values or to
# overwrite defaults from `__run_postfix_maincf_settings_defaults` in
# `vars/main.yml`).
#
# Use standard Postfix option names as keys with their corresponding values.
#
# Dictionary structure:
#
# - Keys: Standard Postfix option names (as defined in postconf documentation)
# - Values: Corresponding configuration values. Common options include:
#     - `myhostname`: FQDN of the mail system
#     - `mydomain`: Domain part of the FQDN
#     - `myorigin`: Domain to append to locally posted mail
#     - `inet_interfaces`: Network interfaces to listen on
#     - `inet_protocols`: IP protocols to use (ipv4, ipv6, all)
#     - `mynetworks`: Trusted SMTP clients for relay
#     - If a value is a list (which can be whitespace or comma-separated in
#       Postfix), it can also be passed as YAML list and will be converted into a
#       comma-separated value string automatically. So all three variants are
#       valid here to define a list as value:
#       ```
#       mynetworks:
#       - "127.0.0.0/8"
#       - "[::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104"
#       - "[::1]/128"
#       mynetworks: "127.0.0.0/8, [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104, [::1]/128"
#       mynetworks: "127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128"
#       ```
#
# Reference commands:
#
# - `postconf``: print all current active values
# - `postconf -n`: print all active, explicitly set options
# - `postconf -d`: print all options with their default
#
# Please note that you do not need own handler for postmap when using
# `hash|btree|dbm:`` somewhere. The role's handler is intelligent enough to scan
# the config for hash|btree|dbm:/path values. Just notify `run_postfix: update
# lookup tables` on changes when writing additional, own tasks.
