# This file defines canonical sender address mappings used by Postfix to
# rewrite recipient email addresses into a standardized or external-facing form.
#
# This is useful for ensuring consistency in outgoing mail, masking internal
# structures, or applying policy-based sender rewriting. It canonical table is
# more powerful than virtual:
#
# - Can apply rules for sender (see {{ __run_postfix_canonicalsender_file }})
#   and recipient addresses (this file).
# - Replacements not only in the SMTP envelope, but also in the mail headers.
#
# The format here is a list of original sender followed by their replacement
# rules. See the following resources for more information:
#
# - https://www.postfix.org/canonical.5.html
