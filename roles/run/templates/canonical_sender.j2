# This file defines address rules used by Postfix to rewrite sender email
# addresses. It can be used to ensure consistency in outgoing mail, masking
# internal structures, or applying policy-based sender rewriting. "canonical"
# is more powerful than "virtual":
#
# - Can apply rules for sender (this file) or recipient addresses (see
#   {{ __run_postfix_table_canonical_recipient_file }}).
# - Replacements not only in the SMTP envelope, but also in the mail headers.
#
# The format here is a list of original sender followed by their replacement
# rules. See the following resources for more information:
#
# - https://www.postfix.org/canonical.5.html
# - https://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#sender_canonical_maps
