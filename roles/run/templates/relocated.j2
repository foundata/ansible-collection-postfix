# This file defines relocated address mappings for Postfix. It is used to tell
# senders that a recipient's address has changed. If someone tries to send email
# to an old address listed here, Postfix generates a non-delivery report (NDR)
# with the new address ("user has moved to <new_location>" bounce messages).
#
# See the following documentation for more details:
# - https://www.postfix.org/relocated.5.html
